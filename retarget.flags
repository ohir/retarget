# retarget.flags big sample
# This sample flags file is for a really big shop. Play a bit with it then
# stick to two flags (eg. +dev +loc) and two knobs (eg. .os, .screen).
# Two plus two equals sixty! Ie. that many integration test cases you might
# need (4 states from two flags, Ã— 5 states of .os knob, Ã— 3 screen sizes).
# This configuration template works with `--sample > lib/filename.dart` test.
#
# Flags:
#     +dev   under development - +dev code may have dragonbugs lurking.
#    +loud   turns on firehose of logs (makes app to crawl on older devices)
#     +lbe   in-house backend, forced. Unset for flytests on AWS/Azure/GCE
#     +18n   apply only to the stable parts of the app (after translations
#            for a given feature were loaded to the cloud and vetted)
#      !ðŸ¦„   You may not do unicorns until you're able to make ordinary ponies
#            happy.   Ie. "would be nice to have" big features are behind +ðŸ¦„.
# !release   +release enables production backends, & guards local dev secrets.
#            You can not pass code to release signer pipeline unless you
#            override forced -release state (set +18n -loud -lbe -dev too).
#            Read the docs, and release rules, Luke!

# line comments start with a sharp in the first column,
# to EOL comment begins at the # past flags or knob variants bar.
#
# ------ TL;DR docs -----------------------------------------------------
# bname: tells the branch name (one then summoned with `retarget @bname`)
#        next line should provide flags and their default predicates:
#        eg. bname: +flagA -flagB *flagC =flagD !flagE %flagF (up to 7)
#
# + - *  tells the stub engine what to put on a new #ifconf pragmas.
#        Also informs the apply engine of default state for the branch.
# = ! %  forbids to simply override respective +, -, or * on the cli.
#        Overrides on the cli must be then forced too.
#
#        Next are knob definitions (up to 7 knobs up to 6 variants each):
# .?name    makes a knob, .variant names follow (min:2 max:6, 7th is .*)
# .+variant makes it a default for this knob (in a branch)
# .=variant forces it to be the only default, others may not be chosen
# .!variant forbids user to choose this variant (in a branch)
#
# All flag and variant names must be unique. Then all defined branches
# must have the same set of flags, knobs, and variants as "main:" has.
# Only predicates ( + - * % ! = ) on flags and variants may differ.
# Thorough the code pragmas must keep order estabilished in "main:".
# Main code configuration itself is one for the bare "retarget @".

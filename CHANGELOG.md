## 0.1.1

- Obey packaging conventions for a commandline tool (ie. move _all_ sources to `bin/`)
- Add example configurations so `pub.dev` readers can take a look without installing the tool.
- Add git hint how to deal with dependencies changing per each target platform.

## 0.1.0

- First published version. Basic functionality works. Apply engine is tested, linter tests are not done yet.

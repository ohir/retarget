--- branch specific notes for main branch ---
There is a peculiar configuration I (ohir) did to not pollute public repo
with artifacts of "alien" testing and experiments in the working branch.
I also personally do not like when public repos come with IDE settings.
So I am trying to exclude a few things from merging to branch, while
having them versioned in trunk. Something that is easy in fossil, but
hard to do in git.

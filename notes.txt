Keeping public repo usable for others is quite hard with git
Someone who just cloned repo should not be forced to change IDE to "mines"
while I'd like to be able do edits for "main" also in an IDE and vim
configured to my tastes.

For now trying the gitattributes path. .git/info/attribute Excludes:
# git config merge.nomerge.driver true
.vimrc               merge=nomerge
notes.txt            merge=nomerge
env.retarget         merge=nomerge
pubspec.lock         merge=nomerge
.vscode/**           merge=nomerge
.dart_tool/**        merge=nomerge
retarget.flags       merge=nomerge
env.retarget.cleanup merge=nomerge
retarget.code-workspace merge=nomerge

This works ONLY IF THERE IS A MERGE CONFLICT!
So once you merge anything FROM main back to the dirty working branch,
this mechanics won't work. It also needs ff=false for merges

This file I normally use as a scratchpad that is excluded from VSCode 
"magic heuristics" see: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/142973
